\title{Craftsman Object for Layout Management}
\description{
The \code{Craftsman} is a virtual object used internally to manage layout-specific
behavior during the \code{ggalign} plot composition process. It defines how a
layout interacts with the domain data, sets up facets and coordinates, and
aligns scales or axis labels accordingly.
}
\details{
This object is used by layout constructors and should not be modified
directly.

\section{Methods}{

The following key methods are implemented:
\itemize{
\item \code{setup_stack_facet()} / \code{setup_stack_coord()} / \code{align_stack_plot()}
\item \code{setup_circle_facet()} / \code{setup_circle_coord()} / \code{align_circle_plot()}
\item \code{build_plot()} / \code{finish_plot()} – finalize plot decorations
\item \code{summary()} – print class info
}
}
